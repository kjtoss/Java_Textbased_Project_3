You are lost on a campus never before seen.  
You may navigate by typing 'n' or 'north', 's' or 'south', 'e' or 'east', or 'w' or 'west'
to move from place to place.  I am sure there is a map to help you!

Using 'm' or 'map' will open a map, if you have it, using 'q' or 'quit' will exit the program,
and using 'h' or 'help' will display possible commands.

In order to add items to inventory, you may find the items at the shop or on the ground.  
Currency has also been implemented.  Type 'i' to view your inventory.
